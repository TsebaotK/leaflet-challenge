# leaflet-challenge

In this Leaflet challenge, I created visualization of earthquake data from all over the world provided by the United States Geological Survey. 
I created a map that plots the last 7 days Earthquake with Magnitude of 2.5 and above using Leaflet. I used the data location longitude and latitude to add Markings to the map. The marker is represented by circles that differ from each other in color and size. The marker size is based on the Earthquake magnitude where it increases with the magnitude. The color is based on the depth of the earthquake with greater depth is given a darker color.
In addition, I added a popup that provides information about the location of the Earthquake, its magnitude, and depth when the marker is clicked. I also created a legend at the bottom right that provides color type and depth range information.
